## Installation

```sh
  npm install aio-store
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

##### First import createStore

```js
//Vanilla js
import { createStore } from "aio-store";

// React user
import { createStore } from "aio-store/react";
```

With that, you can create two types of store.

* **Slice store**: A store that minds his own business
* **Grouped store**: A group of slice stores.

### Slice store

A slice store is just a part of your store. You can divide your store into several slices, or combine slices into one
large
store.<br> When you create a store, you can organize your data or mix it with actions. The choice is yours. But all
actions must be at
root level.<br> In your actions, the first parameter
will always be the store data, his name is yours. If you want to pass other parameters, add them after the first
parameter.<br> Find out more here:
<a href="#passing-parameter-to-actions">Passing parameters</a>.<br> Let's take the following example

#### Create a not organised data store

```js
export const useExpStore = createStore({
  // a data
  exp: 10,
  deep: {
    moreDeep: {
      evenDeep: {
        data: "I'm deep"
      }
    }
  },
  // An action
  updateExp: (slice) => {
    //slice is the store data. {exp: 10, deep: ...}
    slice.exp += 1;
  },
  // a data
  working: true,
  updateDeep: (slice) => {
    //slice is the store data. {exp: 10, deep: ...}
    slice.deep.moreDeep.evenDeep.data = "Ok we got you";
  },
  // ...more data
  // ...more actions
});

```

As you see, data and actions are mixed together and unordered. It is not a problem it will work. 😀

#### Create an organized data store

You can write all data at root level, followed by actions, or group your data like this

* Organised slice with grouped data

```js
export const useExpStore = createStore({
  data: {
    exp: 10,
    working: true,
    deep: {
      moreDeep: {
        evenDeep: {
          data: "I'm deep"
        }
      }
    }
    //...more data
  },
  updateExp: (slice) => {
    slice.data.exp += 1;
  },
  updateDeep: (slice) => {
    //slice is the store data. {exp: 10, deep: ...}
    slice.data.deep.moreDeep.evenDeep.data = "Ok we got you";
  },
  // ...more actions
});
```

* Organised slice with data at root level

```js 
export const useExpStore = createStore({
  exp: 10,
  working: true,
  deep: {
    moreDeep: {
      evenDeep: {
        data: "I'm deep"
      }
    }
  },
  //...more data
  updateExp: (slice) => {
    slice.exp += 1;
  },
  updateDeep: (slice) => {
    //slice is the store data. {exp: 10, deep: ...}
    slice.data.deep.moreDeep.evenDeep.data = "Ok we got you";
  },
  // ...more actions
});

```

#### Use the store

At this point, for React users, you can use it in two ways when using hook or by listening to <a href="#events">
Events</a>.
Let's get the store and extract the part we want.<br>

Vanilla users JUMP here <a href="#events">Events</a>

```js
import { useExpStore } from "./store";

const MyComponent = () => {

  // we get the store and extract exp
  const { exp } = useExpStore();

  // Or
  const { exp } = useExpStore("*");

  // Or
  const { exp } = useExpStore("_D");

  return <span>{exp}</span>;
};
```


With that MyComponent render if `exp` changes and if any value in `useExpStore` change. Sometimes it is what we want, so
it is fine.

* Ask `useExpStore` to extract the part you want for you. This is useful if the component will only
  listen to specific value changes. It is usually what most of us want

```js
//My component

import { useExpStore } from "./store";

const MyComponent = () => {

  // In case of not organized we ask the store to extract exp for us
  const exp = useExpStore("exp");

  // In case of grouped data ,we ask the store to extract exp for us like this
  const exp = useExpStore("data.exp");

  return <span>{exp}</span>;
};
```

#### Autocomplete or IntelliSense

Autocompletion or intellisense is there for you. You don't need to memorize the order of your data.

<img src="assets/autocomplete.png" alt="icon" width="100%" height="auto">

#### Extract actions or data

You can call getActions to get your actions or access your actions through the dispatcher
property

> Note : <br/>
> Every action is chainable. You can use it like this action().action().actions() and so on.
> Or just call action(). It is totally up to you <br/>

* Extract actions

```js
const { putOil } = useCarStore.getActions()

const putOil = useCarStore.dispatcher.putOil;

// And use it like this

putOil() // or 

putOil().takePassengers().drive() //and so on. depends on what you want
```

* Extract all data <br>
  Sometimes we want to extract all the data without the actions, and vice versa. You can proceed as follows

```js
// extract all actions with optimal way
// Making useExpStore PURE DISPATCHER 
const allActions = useExpStore("_A");
// allActions.updateExp().doSomethingElse().updateExp()


// extract all actions with default way
const { actions1, actions2, ...etc } = useExpStore();
// action1().actions2().doSomethingElse().action1()

// extract all data with PURE DATA CONSUMER
const allData = useExpStore("_D")
// console.log(allData.exp)

```

A good tip is to Extract all data only if the Component consumes all of it, else extract the desired part.

#### Performance

Even if you call your action or chain of actions 1000 times in a single click or once,
you'll only get one rendering of your component, not 1000 renderings.<br>
This applies to synchronous actions. Asynchronous actions render the component when they are ready.
We cannot wait for all asynchronous actions to finish before rerender.

#### Optimisation

Usually in any React-based app `process.env.NODE_ENV` is already exposed. And if so, it is good for you because
you are going to get the smallest and fastest version of this library.<br/>
if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is not exposed, expose it your self depending on tools you are using.<br/>

* Maybe webpack `--env.NODE_ENV="production"` when you are building your project
* Maybe cross-env `cross-env NODE_ENV=production` when you are building your project
* Or whatever tools you are using

#### Security

Do not mutate store like that. You will override the reference with a new object and break the store.
Keep this in mind, slice or whatever the name you call it, is there as a reference to your real store.

```js
const useStore = createStore({
  myValue: 10,
  setData: (slice) => {
    // ❌ Bad, Don't do for security and integrity reason.
    slice = {
      myValue: 11
    }
  }
})
```

`slice` is there as reference to your store. Do not override the reference. Do like following lines

```js
const useStore = createStore({
  myValue: 10,
  setData: (slice) => {
    // ✅ Good,
    slice.MyValue = 11
    // ✅ Good,
    slice.MyValue = {
      // ...whatever you want
    }
    // ✅ Good, you can add new Props
    slice.newProp = {
      // ...whatever you want
    }
    // ✅ Good,
    slice.props.data = {
      someData: someValue
      // ...whatever you want
    }
    // ✅ Good,
    slice.props.data.someData += someValue
  }
})
```

#### Chain actions call issue

Use chain actions with caution when using promises. Without promises, there's no risk. Enjoy. But with promises,
Make sure that when calling them, each action updates a different part
of your store and not the same one. Or combine the logic of the actions. For example:

```js
const store = createStore({
  value: 12,
  updateValue: async (slice) => {
    // setSomeData is slow api and finish in 1 second
    const res = await setSomeData();
    console.log(res) // <---- 20
    // ❗ risky, we are updating value in an async operation while another action is doing the same
    slice.value = res
  },
  resetValue: async (slice) => {
    // resetSomeData is fast api and finish in 1ms
    const res = await resetSomeData();
    console.log(res) // <---- 0
    // ❗ risky, we are updating value in an async operation while another action is doing the same
    slice.value = res
  }
})
```

It is risky if we call both actions at the same moment. If we call one by one based on event or something else, It is
fine.
But here

* We can convert action to synchronous, but it is not what we want.
* We can change different part of store, `updateValue` changes `value` and `resetValue` changes another prop. But maybe
  it's not what we want
* We can merge both logics in one action. This is the best thing to do here

Both functions `updateValue` and `resetValue` change the same data `slice.value`. This is why we want to combine
actions.<br>
If they don't change the same property, we can chain like we want even with async actions, no risk at all. But in our
case, using a chain give this
result

```js
// calling in this order
updateValue().resetValue() // <--- output 20

// Calling in this order . We reverse the order
resetValue().updateValue() // <--- output 20
```

* The revers calling `resetValue().updateValue()` match our expectation, because we first reset and then update.
  It is fine but still dangerous because we can't guarantee the response time of the api.
* The default calling `updateValue().resetValue()` output `20`. because `resetValue` finish faster than `updateValue`
  and
  nothing was reset. In fact, none of these is safe. Below is the correct way to achieve what we want

```js
const store = createStore({
  value: 12,
  updateAndResetValue: async (slice) => {
    await setSomeData();
    const res = await resetSomeData();
    console.log(res) // <---- 0
    // ✅ correct, we changes the value only once.
    slice.value = res
  },
})
```

> 🛑 You can change the same value in multiple actions when these actions are synchronous. <br/>
> 🛑 It is not recommended to change the same value in multiple actions when these actions or one of them is
> asynchronous.

We group all actions in one promise and handle every change in the correct order in order to get the correct output: `0`

#### Passing parameter to actions

To finish with actions, you can pass whatever you want to your actions like this

```js
const store = createStore({
  value: 12,
  updateValue: (slice, params1, params2, ...rest) => {
    slice.value = params1 | params2 // or one of rest
  },
})

// Then call it like this
updateValue(params1, params2, otherParams)
```

### Group store

A group store is a group of multiple slices. To create it call the same api `createStore` like that

```js
import { createStore } from "aio-store"

// A group that contain modal and notification
export const useGroupStore = createStore({
  // modal slice
  modal: {
    isOpen: false,
    openModal: (modalStore) => {
      modalStore.isOpen = true
    }
  },
  // notification slice
  notification: {
    message: "Empty",
    updateNotificationMessage: (notificationStore) => {
      notificationStore.message = "Hi, I am here to notify you"
    }
  }

})
```

To use it, just do the same thing as a slice. Since it is a group, it is not advised to extract the
whole group unless you know what you are doing. Intellisense will be there to help you. No need to memoize your
store.<br>

Vanilla users JUMP to <a href="#events">Events</a>

```js
const MyComponent = () => {

  // connecting to the group
  const groupStore = useGroupStore();

  // connecting to modal data with actions
  const modalStore = useGroupStore("modal");

  // connecting to notification data with actions
  const notificationStore = useGroupStore("notification")
}
```

You can also connect your component to nested data in the store like that.

```js
const modalIsOpen = useGroupStore("modal.isOpen")
const notificationMessage = useGroupStore("notification.message")
```

Or get all modalActions making `useGroupStore` PURE DISPATCHER

```js
// all modal actions without data
// this is a PURE DISPATCHER
const modalActions = useGroupStore("modal._A")

// specific modal action with PURE DISPATCHER
const openModal = useGroupStore("modal.openModal")
```

Or get all data

```js
// all modal data without actions
const modalActions = useGroupStore("modal._D")

// specific modal data
const openModal = useGroupStore("modal.isOpen")
```

> We do not enforce rules on your store architecture except for actions who must be at the first level of your store for
> a slice, and group-first level for a grouped store.

```js
// ✅ This is good                       // ✅ This is good. Reversing order is fine
const sliceStore = { |
const sliceStore = {
  ...myData, |
...
myActions,
...
myActions |
...
myData
}                               |
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ✅ This is good.
const myGroupStore = {
  groupOne: {
    ...groupOneData,
    ...groupOneActions
  },
  groupTwo: {
    ...groupTwoData,
    ...groupTwoActions
  }
}

// ❌ This is bad for sliceStore and will be converted to a group by the system
const sliceStore = {
  ...mydata,
  someData: {
    ...myActions
  },
}

// ❌ This is bad for groupStore and will be converted to a slice by the system
const myGroupStore = {
  groupOne: {
    ...groupOneData,
    ...groupOneActions
  },
  ...myActions
}

export const useStore = createStore(sliceStore | myGroupStore)
```

> If we find an action at root level, we create a slice with that action and ignore all other actions.<br>
> If we find an action at the next level, we create a group if no actions are present in the first level and ignore all
> other actions.<br>
> Any very deep level actions will be ignored. You can do what you want with them, but they will dispatch nothing
> * Group store: Actions inside the group-first level,
> * Slice store: Actions at first level

You also have access to an external dispatcher which can be used anywhere in your app. Inside a component or not,
inside a hook or not.

## External dispatcher

> NOTE: It works for group or slice store.

```js
export const useStore = createStore(...);

```

Now you can consume data and dispatch actions.

```js

// This is a PURE DISPATCHER
export const GlobalDispatcher = useStore.dispatcher

// Consume your store like before
const { someData } = useStore();

// PURE DISPATCHER
const actions = useStore("groupKey._A");

// and so on
```

Use the `useStore` in any component like before. Nothing changes. Extract what you want from the store, data, actions,
whatever ...

But now you are able to dispatch action from `GlobalDispatcher` and from any file like this

```js
import GroupGlobalDispatcher from "where_ever_it_is";

//or

import SliceGlobalDispatcher from "where_ever_it_is";

// from a slice store
SliceGlobalDispatcher.someAction().action().action(); //  and so on

// From a group: EX: modal
GroupGlobalDispatcher.modal.action().action(); // and so on

// From a group: EX: yourGroupKey
GroupGlobalDispatcher.yourGroupKey.action().action(); //  and so on
```

## Events

You can listen to certain store events that allow you to receive updates without rendering your component, or if you are
not using React.
Very useful when you want to update something stateless. We all hate unnecessary rendering 😀.

* Listen to `change` event. <br/>
  **change event** is available for both. Group and slice stores. But keep this in mind. You will receive an update for
  all changes in the store,

```js
const myStore = createStore(...);

myStore.on('change', (store) => {
  // do whatever you want,
})
```

The store your callback received contains everything you need to consume or dispatch data.

* Listen to specific change

```js
const myStore = createStore(...);

myStore.listen('data.content.value', (data) => {
  // do what ever you want with your data,
})
```

When listening to a specific part of your store, you can get a snapshot of your store if needed.<br>

#### Vanilla user

```js
const myStore = createStore(...);

// Listen to value changes
myStore.listen('data.content.value', (value) => {
  // Get a snapshot
  const snapshot = myStore();
  console.log(snapshot.data.otherData)
  //or
  snapshot.action().otherActions()
})
```

Get a specific part

```js
 const snapshot = myStore("specific.part");
```

You can also do like React User. See below

#### React user

Since your store is a hook, you will get this error if you try to get a snapshot when using event listener <br>
> [!WARNING]  
> Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component ...

So you can use a function `getSnapshot` to get a snapShot of your store<br>
`getDataSnapshot` for data only <br>
`getActions` for actions only

```js
const myStore = createStore(...);

// Listen to value changes
myStore.listen('data.content.value', (value) => {
  // Get a snapshot or actions
  const snapshot = myStore.getSnapshot();
  const data = myStore.getDataSnapshot();
  const actions = myStore.getActions();
})
```

All event listener return an unsubscribe function

```js
const unsubscribe = myStore.listen('data.someAction', (action) => {
  // do what ever you want with your action,
  // you can also dispatch
})

unsubscribe()
```

And you can also listen to all Data or all actions

```js
// Listen to all Data changes
myStore.listen('_D', (action) => {
  // do some stuff with your data
})

// Listen to all Data changes
myStore.listen('_A', (action) => {
  // do what ever you want with your action,
  // you can also dispatch
})
```

Or if your store is a group, and you want all data or all actions from some key, 

```js
// Listen to all Data changes
myStore.listen('groupKey._D', (action) => {
  // do some stuff with your data
})

// Listen to all Data changes
myStore.listen('groupKey._A', (action) => {
  // do what ever you want with your action,
  // you can also dispatch
})
```
See create a group store <a href="#group-store">HERE</a>

## Interceptors

Interceptors are the guardians of your store. You can delegate all your control to them and keep your store clean.<br>
With them, you can :

* Allow an action (update or deletion)
* Reject an action (update or deletion)
* Override an action (update or deletion)
    * Override by key
    * Override by value
    * Override by key and value

Please use them with caution.<br>
They are designed to be fired on any change in your store.<br>
Do not use them to update the UI, instead use <a href="#events">EVENTS</a> or
<a href="#use-the-store">YOUR STORE</a>
> [!WARNING]  
> Never use interceptors to update your UI. Interceptors are safety provider and are fired on store changes

### Add an interceptor

```js
// If you want to unsubscribe later
const unsubscribe = myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  console.log(store.intercepted)
})

// if you do not want to unsubscribe later
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  console.log(store.intercepted)
})
```

`store.intercepted` contains the intercepted data listed below:

* `intercepted.key`: Target key, (the key of the data that request changes)
* `intercepted.value`: The new value
* `intercepted.state`: The part of the store that request changes
* `intercepted.changePreview`: A preview of changes in the state
* `intercepted.action`: The current action:
  * `update`: When you want to update something in your store
  * `addInSet`: When you want to add something to a Set collection in your store
  * `setInMap`: When you want to set something to a Map collection in your store
  * `delete`: When you want to delete something in your store
  * `deleteInSet`: When you want to delete something from a Set collection in your store
  * `deleteInMap`: When you want to delete something from a Map collection in your store
  * `clearInSet`: When you want to clear a Set collection in your store
  * `clearInMap`: When you want to clear a Map collection in your store
* `intercepted.event`: The intercepted event

With that, let's do some control.

### Reject an action

We want to reject any clear method from our Map collection inside our store

```js
myStore.intercept("data.map", (store) => {
  if (store.intercepted.action !== "clearInMap") {
    store.allowAction();
  } else {
    store.rejectAction()
  }
})
```

### Allow an action with condition

```js
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  if (store.intercepted.value < someMaxValue) {
    // We allow the action
    store.allowAction()
  }
  // This part is optional but you can add it
  else store.rejectAction()
})
```

### Override an action by key

```js
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  if (store.intercepted.value === someMaxValue) {
    // We redirect changes to another key
    store.override.key("otherKey")
  }

})
```

### Override an action by value

```js
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  if (store.intercepted.value === someMaxValue) {
    // We keep the key and change the value
    store.override.value("newValue")
  }

})
```

### Override an action by key and value

```js
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  if (store.intercepted.value === someMaxValue) {
    // We redirect changes to another key with newValue
    store.override.keyAndValue("otherKey", "newValue")
  }
})
```

That's it.
> [!WARNING]<br>
> You can only place one interceptor per value,<br>

```js
// First interceptor
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {

})
// Second interceptor override the first one
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {

})
```

The second override the first one.

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> If you add an interceptor, don't forget to allow, reject or cancel the action.
> Otherwise, it will look like a reject while waiting for your action.

For example

```js
myStore.intercept("data.value", (store) => {
  // You intercept and you do nothing,
  // This is like as a reject, still waiting for an action from you
})
```

It Is similar to a rejection while waiting for an action from you.

> [!NOTE]<br>
> If you intercept `data.content.value`, then you also intercept change on `data` and `data.content`<br>

For example: `data` was `{content: {value: 10}}`, and for some reason `data` becomes a `5`.<br>
We will immediately call your interceptor.<br>
Original line is broken because `content.value` disappears.

The job of that interceptor is to keep the value inside `data.content.value` safe.<br>
But if `data` changes, you need to know if that change will impact your value or not.

You will never intercept change on `data.someThing` or `data.content.something`.
`data.content.something` changes will never impact `data.content.value`.

### Multiple interceptors

You can add many interceptors as you want with once condition. Only one interceptor per value.

```js
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("*", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("data", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("data.content", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("data.content.value", (store) => {})
```

```js
// ❗ is override
myStore.intercept("data", (store) => {})
// ❗ is override
myStore.intercept("data", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("data", (store) => {}) 
```

```js
// ❗ is override
myStore.intercept("*", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("_D", (store) => {})
```
```js
// ❗ is override
myStore.intercept("_D", (store) => {})
// ✅ this one is kept
myStore.intercept("*", (store) => {})
```
`*` and `_D` is the same thing. They both intercept all data changes

#### How we call interceptors

Whether you reverse the order, for example

```js
myStore.intercept("data.content", (store) => {})
// Or
myStore.intercept("data", (store) => {})
// Or
myStore.intercept("data.content.value", (store) => {})
```

`data` interceptor will be called first, then
`data.content` then `data.content.value`.

We always call the interceptors in descending order, from the first to the last key.

#### From one Interceptor to another

If the first called interceptor overrides some value, then the next interceptor will intercept that new value.
Same thing for a key.<br>
If the first interceptor rejects the action, all other interceptors if they exist will be also called to do their check.
Let's take this example.
Our store value is `{data: {content: {value: 10 }}}`

```js
myStore.intercept("data.content", (store) => {
    // We intercept a change where
  if (store.intercepted.value === null) {
    store.rejectAction() 
  } else store.allowAction()
})
myStore.intercept("data.content.value", (store) => {
  // We intercept a change where
  if (store.intercepted.value > 10) {
    store.allowAction()
  } else store.rejectAction()
})
```
If we allow this action, it will brake all other components that are connected to `data.content.value`, `value` will not exist anymore.
Unless if it is what we want, we reject the action.<br>
In the meantime, the second interceptor will never be called, because the line is brake and his hierarchic interceptor rejects the action
for his safety.

#### Interceptors issue ?
My interceptor doesn't intercept anything.
> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
>If you fired an action before registering an interceptor, nothing will be intercepted

```js
// We fired the action ❌
mystore.dispatcher.updateSomeValue();
// We register the interceptor ❌
mystore.intercept("value",(s)=> ...);
```
This will not work. Be sure to register all your interceptors before firing your actions
```js
// We register first ✅
mystore.intercept("value",(s)=> ...);

// And later we fired some action ✅
mystore.dispatcher.updateSomeValue();
```

## Environment

Skip this step if you are using event listener. Every listener is free from HOOK

* **Client side** <br>
  You have nothing to do. It works like charm.
* **Server side**
    * REMIX APP <br>
      You have nothing to do, It works like charm.
    * NEXT-JS APP<br>
      Add `use client` on a component that connect to the store using hook
  ```js
  "use client"
  import .....
  
  const myData = useMyStore();
  ```
    * For another server side rendering framework, Feel free to open an issue if something happens. I will do my best to
      help you.

## Available tools and options

* `createStore` Let you create a store by passing a slice or a group of data and actions.
* `dispatcher` A property attached to your store that lets you dispatch actions from any file.
* `getSnapshot` A Function attached to your store that lets you get a snapshot of your store at any time.
* `getDataSnapshot` A Function attached to your store that lets you get a snapshot that only contain the data of your store at any time.
* `getActions` A Function attached to your store that lets you get all actions in your store at any time.
* `on` A Function attached to your store that lets listen to all `change` in your store.
* `listen` A Function attached to your store that lets you listen to changes in a specific part of your store.
* `intercept` A Function attached to your store that lets you intercept changes in your store.
* `._D` A key that can be passed to your store in order to get all data in that store making it a PURE DATA
  CONSUMER.
* `groupKey._D` A key that can be passed to your grouped store in order to get all data in that store making it a PURE
  DATA CONSUMER. `groupKey` is the name of your group
* `*` A key that can be passed to your store in order to get everything in that store. It is similar to passing
  nothing. You can also use it to intercept, or listen to all changes in your store.
