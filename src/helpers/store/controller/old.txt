       *
       * Suppose the first interceptor INT_ONE comes with event => "data.content.value",

       * We do the same thing as adding its listener to 'data' and 'data.content'.
       *
       * 'Data' has new listener, 'data.content' also, and 'data.content.value' keeps its old listener and that is the problem.
       * Because  INT_TWO can only care about him and allow some action that affect 'data.content.value'.
       *
       * Also, remember this.
       * Every doted key far from the root key has priority on other keys
       * So, when the length is greater, the old event has a lower priority. We need to override the oldInterceptor event with the new one.
       * For next check.
       *
       * If the length is the same and event is the same, then we keep the latest one
       *
       * And of course, if no listener is present, we just add the new one.
