   * But all functions inside 'data.content' and 'data.content.value'
   * will remain the same.
   * This is for avoiding calling two interceptors at the same time.
   * Every interceptor near the rootKey will have the priority on others.
   * Once they finish their work, if they allow the operations, nested interceptors will be called if they are present.

       * If so, we check if the length of interceptor event is greater than the new event.
       * If it is greater, we override the old listener with the new one.
       * Let me explain why we do that
       *
       * Suppose the first interceptor INT_ONE comes with event => "data.content.value",
       * Its listener is added to 'data', 'data.content' and  'data.content.value' as we learn.
       * Fine. Now another interceptor INT_TWO comes with this event => 'data.content'.
       * We do the same thing as adding its listener to 'data' and 'data.content'.
       *
       * 'Data' has new listener, 'data.content' also, and 'data.content.value' keeps its old listener and it is fine.
       *
       * But why do we need to check the length ???.
       *
       * Just reverse the order that event are come in, and you will understand.
       * INT_ONE comes with "data.content" and INT_TWO comes with "data.content.value".
       *
       * So 'data' will finally have INT_TWO listener, same for 'data.content' and also 'data.content.value'.
       *
       * WHERE IS THE INT_ONE LISTENER ???.
       *
       * ITS gone, and we don't want that.
       *
       * By checking the length of the event, 'data.content' is lower than 'data.content.value',
       * So when we are on 'data' key, the length is lower, we do not touch listener
       * When on 'data.content' length is same, we do not touch listener
       * When on 'data.content.value', length is great, we override listener.
       *
       * I hope you understand the trick.
       *
       * Also, remember this.
       * Every doted key near the root key has priority on other keys
       * So, when the length is lower, the event is a priority. We need to override the oldInterceptor event with the new one.
       * For next check.
       *
       * If the length is the same and event is the same, then we keep the latest one
       *
       * And of course, if no listener is present, we just add the new one.
       * We increment the total of interceptors for later
